# dot-emacs

My Emacs configuration files.  I created this repos to organize my > 2,000 line *init.el* file into a logical structure. Ideally, this could be used on a new machine without any manual setup. At the minimum, I aim to drastically reduce manual set up time on a new machine while keeping all the Emacs goodies I love.
